State of the art document for crack detection:

Who:
- Pang‐jo Chun   Department of Civil Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan 
- Shota Izumi    Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan 
- Tatsuro Yamane Department of International Studies, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo

Title: 
- Automatic detection method of cracks from concrete surface imagery using two‐step light gradient boosting machine

What they did:
- supervised machine learning: an automated crack detection method based on image processing using the light gradient boosting machine
- reduced calculation converting to grayscale images (using the maximum value of the RGB components -> elements like graffiti are removed and cannot be mistaken for cracks)
- correction using a median filter
- they consider geometrical characteristics of the cracks to detect noise

Tools:
- LightGBM (open-source gradient boosting framework used for machine learning tasks)
