State of the art – crack detection:

Authors: Chunde Yang, Mingyue Geng

They proposed 2 methods for the crack detection:
1.	Gradient information map extraction:
Due to the brightness of the crack pixels in the actual image are low, the proportion is small and the gradient value of the edge pixels are large. In order to keep the main body information of the crack edge to a greater extent and to locate the crack region more quickly, thus, we propose a new adaptive image thresholding method based on grayscale gradient features separates the edge of the crack from the background.
2.	Edge Extraction Based on Single Pixel Percolation:
The percolation model is a statistical model that simulates problems related to percolation mechanics. The percolation is the flow of fluid in porous media, it starts at an initial point, and it spreads to the surrounding according to the probability, which is a measure of the ease of percolation. By repeating the process, the region spreads in the surroundings and reaches the boundary.
