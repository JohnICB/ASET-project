State of the art document for crack detection:

Who:
Young-Jin Cha & Wooram Choi Department of Civil Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada
Oral Buyukozturk: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA

What they used:
    They proposed a vision-based method using a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
for detecting concrete cracks without calculating the defect features. As CNNs are capable of learning 
image features automatically, they proposed a method which works without the conjugation of image processing
techniques (IPT) for extracting features, which was a method used in the passed, but very inefficient.
How they did it:
    To train a CNN classiÔ¨Åer they used raw images of concrete surfaces with a broad range of image variations, including 
lighting, shadow, etc., capable of potentially triggering false alarms, are taken from a complex Engineering 
building using a DSLR camera. All the pictures were stored in a database at a high resolution. When training the
CNNs the pictures were downscaled to a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels to improve the training times. Another 
technique they used is to randomly crop areas from the picture and used them in the training aswell.

Tools used:
DSLR Camera, database
